epidermis_definition_  epidermis  integumentry_system_  ; definition: The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, it is made up of epithelial cells

epidermis_parts_  epidermis  integumentry_system_  ; parts: The epidermis contains two types of pigments and proteins the keratin and the Melanin

epidermis_reproduction_  epidermis  integumentry_system_  ; reproduction: The epidermis is mostly made up of dead cells which get replaced my a process called mitosis

epidermis_layers_  epidermis  integumentry_system_  ; layers: The epidermis is made-up of two layers the first one is composed of dead epithelial cells

dermis_definition_  dermis  integumentry_system_  ; definition: the dermis is the second layer underneath the skin

dermis_tissues_  dermis  integumentry_system_  ; tissues: The dermis is made of connective tissues which provide support for the body and prevent the body from tearing apart

connective_tissues_  integumentry_system_  ;  the connective tissue supports the body and prevents it from tearing apart, it also makes the skin elastic

nerve_tissues_  integumantry_system_  ; Nerve tissues are tissues are tissues responciple for skin sensation

subcutaneous_layer_  integumentry_system_  ; The subcutaneous layer is the third layer of the skin, it is composed of fat cells which maintain homeostasis

sebaceous_gland_  integumentry_system_  ; The sebaceous gland is a gland that lubricates the skin by realizing a lubricant named sebum

what_is_sebum_  sebum  ; Definition: A lubricant realized by the sebaceous gland to humidify the air

what_realises_sebum_ sebum  integumentry_system_  ;  Sebum is realized by the sebaceous gland

melanin  ; Melanin is a pigment found in the epidermis layer which protects internal organs from Ultraviolet rays, melanin also effects the person color

keratin  ; Keratin is a protein found in the epidermis layer, it water profs organs under neath the skin

chemical_reaction_  ; involve rearrangement and exchange of atoms, producing new molecules

chemical_reaction_ defintion_of_chemical_reaction_  ;  Definition of chemical reaction: involve rearrangement and exchange of atoms, producing new molecules

chemical_equation_  ;  a way to understand the chemical changes that take place between chemicals.

chemical_reaction_  evidence_of_chemical_reaction_  proof_of_chemical_reaction_  ; Evidence of chemical reaction: Color change, Precipitate formation, Gas bubbles,  Large energy changes: Container becomes very

hot or cold, Emission of light

parts_of_chemical_reaction_  chemical_reaction_  ; Reactants Products

Symbols_used_in_chemical_equations  ; 1:the arrow separates the reactants from the products 2: The plus sign = and 3: (s) after the formula -solid 4: (g) after the formula -gas 5:
(l) after the formula -liquid

Symbols_used_in_chemical_equations  ; 1: (aq) after the formula  dissolved in water  2: ↑ used after a product indicates a gas (same as (g)) 3: ↓ used after a product indicates a solid (same as (s))

types_of_chemical_equations_  ;  1- word equation  2- skeletal equation   3- balanced chemical equation

word_equations_  ; A method used to present a chemical reaction using words Ex: Sodium + Chlorine --> Sodium chloride

skelton_equations_  ; A method used to present a chemical reaction using symbols and letters Ex: Na + Cl2 --> NaCl

types_of_chemical_reactions_  ; 1: Synthesis  2: Decomposition  3: Single replacement  4: Double replacement  5: Combustion

Synthesis_reaction_  types_of_chemical_reactions_   ; Syntehsis:  A type of chemical reaction in which two or more  elects combine to form one element EX: A+B→AB

decomposition_reaction_  types_of_chemical_reactions_   ; decomposition: A type of chemical reaction in which one elements get braked into 2 or more different elements EX: AB→A+B

single_replacement_  types_of_chemical_reactions_   ; single replacement: A type of chemical reaction in which one element replaces a similar element in a compound EX: A+BC→AC+BX

double_replacement_  types_of_chemical_reactions_   ; double replacement: A type of chemical reaction in which one element replaces a similar element in a compound EX: A+BC→AC+BX

combustion_reaction_  types_of_chemical_reactions_  ; Combustion reaction: is a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. 
Combustion reactions must involve oxygen as one reactant. The combustion of hydrogen gas produces water vapor EX: HC+O --> water vapor + heat
